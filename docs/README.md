## Errors

### File Error (IOException)
If the file cannot be saved or created, Duke prints the file error message, prompting the user to check the file in the mentioned path. Note that if the duke.txt file is not found, Duke will automatically create it. 
Kindly ensure that there is a /data/ folder at any point of time. 

Example in Windows:
```
WARNING: The list file data\duke.txt cannot be created and saved. Please ensure that the data folder exists in the same path as the JAR file. Type 'bye' and add the data folder before starting Duke again.
```

Example in Unix/ macOS:
```
The list file data/duke.txt is not found and/or cannot be created/saved. Please check.
```

### Incorrect Date format (DateTimeParseException)
If the datetime format when adding Deadline or Event is not the right format, Duke prints the date format error message, prompting the user to check the required format by typing `help`.

Example:
```
The date format is not correct. Please type 'help' to check the date format for Events/Deadlines.
```

### Adding a Deadline/ Event without the proper format (StringIndexOutOfBoundsException)
If there is no proper description and datetime when creating deadline and event, Duke will print the short description error message, prompting the user to check the required format by typing `help`. 

Example:
```
The description is too short. Please type 'help' to check the date format for Events/Deadlines.
```

### Marking, Unmarking and Deleting more than 1 task at a time (NumberFormatException)
If a user happens to use mark, unmark or delete in this way, i.e. " mark 1 2", Duke prints the out of range message, prompting the user to type `list` to check the number of items on the list. 

### Blank Task Description
If a user types "todo " or "deadline " or "event ", Duke prints the blank description error message, prompting the user to type `help` to check the format for Todo/Deadlines/Events.
